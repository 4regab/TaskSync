# TaskSync Examples & Workflows

Complete examples showing how to use TaskSync effectively with your AI coding assistant, featuring the new infinite monitoring and separate log file system.

## üöÄ Example 1: Web Application Development with Dual File System

### Initial Task Assignment
Start by creating or editing your `tasks.txt` file:

```text
# Project: User Management System
Create a modern web application with:
1. User registration with email verification
2. Login/logout functionality  
3. Password reset feature
4. User profile management
5. Responsive design with modern UI

Tech stack: React, Node.js, MongoDB
```

### Separate Log File for Status Monitoring
The AI automatically creates and maintains `log.txt`:

```text
=== TASKSYNC MONITORING LOG ===
Session: #1
Task file: tasks.txt

--- MONITORING STATUS ---
Check #1: - Read tasks.txt containing 8 lines. Beginning project setup.
Check #2: - Read tasks.txt containing 8 lines. User registration component 30% complete.
Check #3: - Read tasks.txt containing 8 lines. Authentication system in progress.
```

### Real-Time Corrections with Persistent Monitoring
As the AI works, you can provide corrections without stopping by editing `tasks.txt`:

```text
# CORRECTION: Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
# CORRECTION: Add input validation for all forms
# CORRECTION: Use bcrypt for password hashing
```

### The log.txt file continues tracking:

```text
Check #7: - Read tasks.txt containing 11 lines. Applying TypeScript conversion and security improvements.
Check #8: - Read tasks.txt containing 11 lines. Input validation implementation 70% complete.
```

### Adding New Requirements During Development
Append new tasks as the project evolves by editing `tasks.txt`:

```text
# NEW TASK: Add OAuth2 login (Google, GitHub)
# NEW TASK: Implement role-based access control
# NEW TASK: Add unit tests with Jest
```

### The AI Will Automatically:
- ‚úÖ Read your updates every 30-60 seconds continuously
- ‚úÖ Integrate new requirements seamlessly without stopping
- ‚úÖ Apply corrections without losing context
- ‚úÖ Log status updates in separate `log.txt` file with check counting
- ‚úÖ **Continue indefinitely** until you manually terminate
- ‚úÖ Report progress and ask for clarification if needed

## üîç Understanding AI Internal States and Dual File System

Your AI assistant reports its internal state with each response and maintains separate log file tracking:

```text
[INTERNAL: Current state - Active]
[INTERNAL: Next check scheduled every 60 seconds to 5 minutes]
```

### State Meanings

- **Active**: AI is working on tasks and monitoring for updates continuously
- **Monitoring**: AI completed current tasks, waiting for new instructions indefinitely

### Dual File System Format

**tasks.txt** (clean, user-editable):
```text
# Current Priority
Fix the authentication bug in login.tsx
Add TypeScript types for user profile

# New Feature Request  
Create a dashboard component with charts
```

**log.txt** (agent-managed monitoring):
```text
=== TASKSYNC MONITORING LOG ===
Session: #1
Task file: tasks.txt

--- MONITORING STATUS ---
Check #[X]: - Read tasks.txt containing [Y] lines. [Status message]
```

### Status Log Examples

```text
=== TASKSYNC MONITORING LOG ===
Session: #1
Task file: tasks.txt

--- MONITORING STATUS ---
Check #1: - Read tasks.txt containing 7 lines. No new instructions found.
Check #2: - Read tasks.txt containing 7 lines. No new instructions found.
Check #3: - Read tasks.txt containing 12 lines. NEW INSTRUCTIONS FOUND!
Check #15: - Read tasks.txt containing 14 lines. Authentication system 90% complete.
Check #42: - Read tasks.txt containing 18 lines. All tasks completed, monitoring for new instructions.
```

### Key Features

- **Count-Based Monitoring**: Each check increments from #1 indefinitely
- **Line Count Verification**: Reports exact count of tasks.txt content
- **Separate File System**: tasks.txt stays clean, log.txt contains all monitoring history
- **Real-Time Updates**: Status written to log.txt with each check
- **Infinite Operation**: AI continues monitoring until manually terminated
- **No Automatic Termination**: You must explicitly say "stop" to end the session

## üìù tasks.txt Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Good Examples

```text
# Clear, actionable tasks
Create user registration form with:
- Email validation
- Password strength requirements
- Confirm password field
- Terms of service checkbox

# Specific technical requirements
Use React Hook Form for validation
Style with Tailwind CSS
Add loading states and error messages
```

### ‚ùå Avoid These

```text
# Too vague
Make the app better

# No context
Fix the bug

# Missing requirements
Add authentication
```

### üéØ Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Include tech stack, requirements, and constraints
2. **Use Comments**: Organize tasks with `#` comments for clarity
3. **Set Priorities**: Use keywords like `URGENT`, `HIGH PRIORITY`, `LATER`
4. **Include Context**: Explain the why, not just the what
5. **Break Down Large Tasks**: Split complex features into smaller steps

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### AI Not Responding to tasks.txt Changes

**Possible Causes:**

- File permissions issue
- AI monitoring disrupted 
- File encoding problems
- Tasks.txt not in correct location

**Solutions:**

```text
# Add this to your tasks.txt to test monitoring:
# TEST: If you can read this, monitoring is working
# Current time: [your current time]

# Check STATUS LOG for monitoring activity:
--- STATUS LOG ---
Check #[X]: - Read tasks.txt containing [Y] lines. [Status message]
```

### AI Misunderstanding Instructions

**Improve Your Instructions:**

```text
# Instead of: "Add validation"
# Use this: "Add form validation with these rules:
- Email must be valid format
- Password minimum 8 characters
- Phone number must be 10 digits
- All fields required before submission"
```

### Wanting to End Session

**Remember - No Automatic Termination:**

- AI operates indefinitely until manually stopped
- Check STATUS LOG for ongoing monitoring activity
- Monitor incrementing check numbers to verify operation

**To Stop the AI:**

```text
# Add to tasks.txt or say directly:
# TERMINATE: Stop monitoring and end session
# Or say: "stop", "end", "terminate", or "quit"
```

### Monitoring Issues

**Check For:**

- STATUS LOG entries not incrementing
- File write permission errors
- Missing check count progression
- AI not reading complete file content

**Quick Fix:**

```text
# Add to tasks.txt to restart monitoring:
# RESTART: Continue working on current tasks
# STATUS: Please report current progress
# VERIFY: Read this entire file and log status

--- STATUS LOG ---
Check #1: - Read tasks.txt containing [X] lines. Monitoring restarted.
```

Remember: TaskSync agents operate with infinite monitoring - they never automatically terminate and continue working until you explicitly stop them!
Remember: TaskSync works best when you provide clear, detailed instructions and maintain regular communication through your tasks.txt file!
