This simple prompt instructions helps you  work more efficiently, reduce premium request usage, and allow you to give the agent new instructions or feedback after completing a task. This is similar to Interactive/Enhanced Feedback MCP. 

## What This Does

TaskSync is a **terminal-based task agent** with direct terminal communication. Your coding agent will actively requests tasks or feedback through `$task = Read-Host "Enter your task"` command, executes tasks autonomously, and operates forever until you stop it.

## Features
- **Human-in-the-loop workflow** - Provide feedback or new task, saving you premium requests on your AI IDEs
- **Terminal-based agent interaction** - Your AI becomes a persistent terminal agent that actively requests tasks
- **Autonomous operation** - Agent runs continuously requesting and executing tasks 
- **Never terminates automatically** - maintains persistent operation until you explicitly say "stop", "end", "terminate", or "quit"


## Getting Started
1. **Get the TaskSync Prompt**: Copy or download the prompt from [here](https://github.com/4regab/TaskSync/blob/main/Prompt/tasksync.md).

**Optional: Specs Workflow** *(Alternative structured approach)*: For users who prefer Kiro-style spec-driven development, you can use the [Specs-Tasksync](https://github.com/4regab/TaskSync/blob/main/Prompt/specs-tasksync.md) instead. This approach transforms ideas into structured requirements, design documents, and task lists before implementation. Simply provide the TaskSync or Specs Workflow file as context, then specify in chat which file your agent will follow.

3. **Initialize Agent**: Provide the TaskSync v4 protocol file (`tasksync.md`) or (`specs-tasksync.md`) as context to your AI IDE or agent and type in chat: `Strictly follow TaskSync Protocol #tasksync.md or specs-tasksync.md` to activate.
4. **Agent Activation**: The agent immediately becomes a terminal-based autonomous agent and announces initialization.
5. **Task Input**: Agent executes `$task = Read-Host "Enter your task"` and waits for your input.

**Note:** Task must be entered as a single line. When pasting in terminal, click "Paste as One Line".

## Best Practices and VS Code Copilot Settings

Because agent mode depends heavily on tool calling, it's recommended that you turn on "Auto Approve" in the settings. Note that this will allow the agent to execute commands in your terminal without asking for permission. I also recommend bumping "Max Requests" to 999 to keep the agent working on long running tasks without asking you if you want it to continue.

You can do that through the settings UI or via your user settings json file:

```json
"chat.tools.autoApprove": true,
"chat.agent.maxRequests": 999
```

It's best to keep the TaskSync session for 1-2 hours maximum since the longer the conversation, the more hallucinations may occur. Start it in a new chat session when needed for optimal performance.
