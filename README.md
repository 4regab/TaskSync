# TaskSync
**Save money on your AI coding IDEs.** This simple prompt insutrctions helps your AI work better and use less premium requests.

## What This Does
TaskSync is just **prompt instructions** that make your AI smarter. Instead of typing lots of messages back and forth, you write what you want in a simple text file called `tasks.txt`. Your AI reads this file and does the work by itself.

## Why You Need This
**Premium AI tools are expensive.** Every time you chat with AI, it costs money. Most people waste requests because:
- AI doesn't understand what you want
- You have to explain the same thing many times  
- AI forgets what you're building
- You need to watch AI and fix its mistakes

## How TaskSync Helps
‚úÖ **Write once, let AI work** - Put your ideas in `tasks.txt` and AI does everything  
‚úÖ **AI checks for updates automatically** - Change your tasks.txt file anytime, AI will see it  
‚úÖ **No more explaining** - AI remembers your whole project  
‚úÖ **AI fixes itself** - When AI makes mistakes, it reads your notes and fixes them  
‚úÖ **Works with any AI tool** - GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Trae IDE, and more  
‚úÖ **Save 80-90% of your premium AI requests.** Instead of 50 messages, you might only need 5-10.

## How It Works

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e2cbd1-1029-4f2e-94d4-25ae5af2bd12

1. **Drag the tasksync instructions** to chat
2. **Add tasks in tasks.txt file** 
3. **Write what you want** 
4. **Let AI work alone** - it checks for updates automatically
5. **Change tasks.txt anytime** to follow next insutructions or make it fix its mistakes.

**Start saving money today.** Get the better results with way fewer premium requests.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Copy rule file** to your project root
2. **Edit `tasks.txt`** anytime to give AI new instructions in real-time
3. **AI monitors** `tasks.txt` every 60 seconds
4. **Autonomous execution** with state management

### TaskSync Protocol Features
- **Real-Time Communication**: Edit `tasks.txt` anytime to communicate with AI
- **Autonomous Execution**: Independent task completion  
- **State Management**: Active ‚Üí Monitoring ‚Üí Terminating
- **Security First**: No hardcoded secrets, OWASP compliance
